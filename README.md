Task 1
The program takes an integer input from the user.

It checks whether the number is even or odd by using the modulus operator (%).

If number % 2 == 0, it means the number is divisible by 2 → Even number.

Otherwise → Odd number.

It then prints the result with the actual number.

Example:
Input: 7 → Output: 7 is an odd number
Input: 12 → Output: 12 is an even number

Task 2:
The program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50.

It uses a for loop to iterate through each number between 1 and 50.

Each number is added to the variable sum.

Finally, it prints the total sum.

Example:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is 1275.
